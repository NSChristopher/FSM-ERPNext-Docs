# Labour Welfare Fund (LWF)

The Labour Welfare Fund (LWF) is a statutory contribution collected by state governments under their respective Labour Welfare Fund Acts. India Payroll automates LWF deduction on Salary Slips based on the employee's work state and the payroll month.

> LWF amounts are **flat fixed amounts per employee**, not percentages of salary.

## 1\. How to Enable

1.  Go to **Payroll Settings → India Payroll** tab.
2.  Check **Enable LWF Deduction**.

## 4\. Employment State

LWF is determined by the **Employment State** set on the **Salary Structure Assignment**. The same field is used by Professional Tax, so it only needs to be set once per assignment.

* * *

## 5\. Per-Employee Exemptions

Some employees may be exempt from LWF by local law (e.g., contract workers, employees above a certain grade in specific states, or directors). India Payroll provides a per-employee exemption flag.

### How to Exempt an Employee

1.  Open the **Salary Structure Assignment** document.
2.  Go to the **Labour Welfare Fund** section.
3.  Check **LWF Exempted**.
4.  Fill in **LWF Exemption Reason** (optional, for audit trail).

> **Key behaviour:** The `lwf_exempted` flag is **never auto-overridden** by the hook. Only an HR user with write access to the Employee document can change it. This ensures manual exemptions are preserved across all payroll runs.
