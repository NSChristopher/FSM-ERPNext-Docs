# Employee CTC Break-Up

**The Employee CTC Break-up report presents an employee's Cost to Company broken down by salary component. For each component it shows the per-cycle amount, the annual amount, and the share of CTC that the component represents.**

The report is generated for a single [Salary Structure Assignment](https://docs.frappe.io/hr/salary-structure-assignment), so it always reflects the structure and CTC assigned to that employee.

To access the Employee CTC Break-up report, go to:

> Home > Payroll > Employee CTC Break-up

## **1\. Prerequisites**

Before viewing the report, the following must exist:

1.  [Employee](https://docs.frappe.io/hr/employee)
2.  [Salary Structure](https://docs.frappe.io/hr/salary-structure)
3.  [Salary Structure Assignment](https://docs.frappe.io/hr/salary-structure-assignment) with a CTC set

## **2\. How to view the report**

There are two ways to open the report:

1.  From a Salary Structure Assignment, click Actions > See CTC Break-up. The Employee and Salary Structure Assignment are selected automatically.
2.  Go to Employee CTC Break-up and select the Company, Employee, and Salary Structure Assignment.

## **3\. Report columns**

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Component | The salary component, shown with its abbreviation. |
| Type | Fixed for a flat amount, or Formula for a derived one. |
| Formula/Amount | The formula text, or the fixed amount. |
| Monthly / Fortnightly / ... | The per-cycle amount. The column title follows the payroll frequency. |
| Annual | The per-cycle amount multiplied by the number of cycles per year. |
| Percent of CTC (%) | The component's share of total CTC. |

## **4\. Sections**

The components are grouped into sections. Each section opens with a bold totals row that sums the components below it. The sections appear in this order:

1.  Earnings
2.  Deductions
3.  Tax Deductions
4.  Employer Contributions
5.  Total Net Earnings
6.  Total Gross Earnings

Employer contributions appear after the Tax Deductions section and before the net and gross totals. A section with no components still shows its totals row at zero, so the layout is consistent across employees.

## **5\. Understanding the totals**

-   Gross is the sum of payable earnings.
-   Net is gross minus deductions and tax.
-   CTC is gross plus employer contributions and any non-payout earnings, annualised.

Because employer contributions are part of CTC but not of net pay, two assignments with the same CTC can result in different take-home pay, depending on how much of the CTC is made up of employer contributions. The report makes this split visible.

For how employer-contribution components are configured, see [Salary Component](https://docs.frappe.io/hr/salary-component).
