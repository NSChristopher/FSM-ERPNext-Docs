**Use case:** If an employee works on a Holiday and wants to apply for a compensatory off, the following process is important in Frappe HR:

1.  Create an **Employee** with the mandatory details and assign a **Holiday List** and a **Leave Policy** to it.
    
2.  Attendance should be marked for the Employee, it is mandatory for the employee to be marked as present on the Holiday \[this Holiday should be in the Holiday List.\]
