# Installation

Frappe Insights can be installed in several ways depending on your requirements. You can choose to install it on Frappe Cloud, the cloud version of Frappe Insights, or on your own server. The following sections describe the installation methods in detail.

## Managed Hosting

Install Frappe Insights with one click on [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com/insights/signup). Frappe Cloud is a managed hosting platform that makes installation and maintenance easy. Sign up [here](https://frappecloud.com/insights/signup) to get started. Your instance will be ready in minutes. We recommend trying Frappe Cloud before self-hosting.

If you have an existing Frappe Cloud site, you can install Frappe Insights from the [Frappe Cloud Marketplace](https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/insights).

## Self Hosting

### Production Setup

1.  First, download the installation script:
    
    ```
    wget https://frappe.io/easy-install.py
    ```
    
2.  Run this command to install Frappe Insights:
    
    ```
    python3 ./easy-install.py deploy \
        --project=insights_prod_setup \
        --email=your_email.example.com \
        --image=ghcr.io/frappe/insights \
        --version=stable \
        --app=insights \
        --sitename subdomain.domain.tld
    ```
    

You need to change two things in this command:

-   Replace `your_email.example.com` with your actual email address
-   Replace `subdomain.domain.tld` with your website domain name

The setup will take about 5 minutes. After that, you'll have a ready-to-use Frappe Insights instance.
