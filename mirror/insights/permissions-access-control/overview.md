# Overview

#### This guide explains how to control data access in Insights using teams, permissions and row-level security

> Note: Make sure you have `Insights Admin` role in order to configure user permissions

Insights provides three levels of access control:

1.  **Application-level**: Role-based access (Insights Admin, Insights User)
2.  **Resource-level**: Team-based access to data sources, tables, dashboards, charts
3.  **Row-level**: Filter-based restrictions on table data (e.g., show only assigned customers)

### Permission Hierarchy

```
User → Team(s) → Resources (Data Sources/Tables) → Row Filters
```

-   Users are assigned to one or more teams
-   Teams are granted access to specific resources
-   Resources can have row-level filters applied
