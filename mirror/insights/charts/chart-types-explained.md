# Choosing the right Chart

### Chart Types Explained

#### Number Chart

Best for: Displaying one or more key metrics prominently

##### Perfect when

-   You want to show a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) at a glance
-   You're building a dashboard header with important numbers
-   You want to compare this month vs last month

##### Example uses

-   Total Revenue: $1.2M
-   Active Users: 5,432
-   Conversion Rate: 3.4%

##### How to Configure

1.  Columns: Choose which numbers to display  
    Can show multiple numbers side by side  
    Each gets its own big display
2.  Date Column (optional): For comparisons and sparklines  
    Enables "Show comparison" feature  
    Shows percent change from previous period
3.  Formatting:  
    Prefix: Add $ or other symbols before the number  
    Suffix: Add % or other symbols after  
    Decimal places: How many decimals to show  
    Shorten numbers: Turn 1,200,000 into 1.2M
4.  Advanced:  
    Show comparison: Display % change from previous period (needs date column)  
    Negative is better: Green when numbers go down (for costs, errors, etc.)  
    Show sparkline: Mini line chart showing the trend  
    Sparkline color: Choose the line color

##### Pro Tips

Use Number charts at the top of dashboards for immediate impact  
Keep it to 34 numbers max for readability  
Enable comparisons to show if metrics are improving  
Use sparklines to show trend direction at a glance

#### Bar Chart

Best for: Comparing values across categories

##### Perfect when

Comparing sales across regions  
Showing revenue by product  
Ranking top performers

Example: Monthly sales comparison, Product category performance

##### How to Configure

1.  XAxis: Choose your categories (Region, Product, Month, etc.)  
    This is what appears along the bottom  
    Can rotate labels if names are long
2.  YAxis: Choose what to measure (Sales, Count, Average, etc.)  
    Add multiple measures to show several bars per category  
    Set min/max values to zoom in on a range  
    Show data labels to display exact values on bars
3.  Chart Style:  
    Stack: Stack multiple series on top of each other (see total height)  
    Overlap: Show bars side by side overlapping  
    Normalize: Show as 100% stacked (proportions)
4.  Split By (optional): Break down each category further  
    Example: Sales by Month, split by Region  
    Each month shows multiple bars (one per region)  
    Limit max splits to avoid clutter (default: 10)

##### Pro Tips

Use horizontal labels for short names, rotate for long names  
Stack bars when you want to show total AND composition  
Side-by-side bars are easier to compare exact values  
Limit categories to 1015 for readability

When to Use Bar vs Row:  
Bar (vertical): Better for time periods (months, quarters)  
Row (horizontal): Better for many categories or long labels

#### Row Chart

Best for: Comparing categories horizontally (same as Bar chart, rotated)

##### Perfect when

You have many categories to compare  
Category names are long  
You want to rank items top to bottom

Example: Top 20 products by sales, Employee performance rankings

Row charts are configured exactly like Bar charts, just rotated 90 degrees. All the same options apply!

##### When to use Row instead of Bar

Long category names (easier to read horizontally)  
Ranking lists (top to bottom feels natural)  
Many categories (vertical scrolling is easier)

#### Line Chart

Best for: Showing trends over time

##### Perfect when

Tracking revenue over months  
Monitoring daily active users  
Showing seasonal patterns

Example: Sales trend over 12 months, Website traffic by day

##### How to Configure

1.  XAxis: Usually a date/time column  
    Set granularity: day, week, month, year  
    Rotate labels if needed
2.  YAxis: What to plot (Sales, Users, Orders, etc.)  
    Add multiple lines to compare trends  
    Each line can be a different color
3.  Line Style:  
    Curved lines: Smooth curves vs straight lines  
    Show area: Fill the area under the line  
    Show data points: Display dots at each data point
4.  Split By (optional): Create multiple lines  
    Example: Revenue over time, split by Region  
    Creates one line per region  
    Each line autocolored differently

##### Pro Tips

Line charts are THE best choice for time series data  
Use curved lines for a polished look  
Show area fill to emphasize magnitude  
Avoid more than 57 lines (gets messy)  
Use different colors for each line

##### Common Patterns

Month-over-month growth: Xaxis = Month, Yaxis = Total Sales  
Daily actives: Xaxis = Day, Yaxis = Count of Users  
Comparison: Use split by to show multiple products on same chart

#### Donut Chart

Best for: Showing parts of a whole (proportions)

##### Perfect when

Market share breakdown  
Budget allocation  
Traffic sources distribution

Example: Sales by Product Category (shows % of total), Revenue by Region

##### How to Configure

1.  Label Column: The categories (Product, Region, Source, etc.)  
    Each unique value becomes a slice
2.  Value Column: What to measure (Sales, Count, etc.)  
    Determines slice size  
    Automatically shows as percentages
3.  Display Options:  
    Legend Position: Top, Bottom, Left, or Right  
    Max Slices: Limit slices (groups small values into "Others")  
    Inline Labels: Show labels inside slices instead of in legend

##### Pro Tips

Best with 37 categories (too many slices = hard to read)  
Set max slices to group small values into "Others"  
Use inline labels when you have few, large slices  
Colors autoassigned, but you can't customize them per slice

Donut vs Pie: Donuts look more modern and are easier to label. They're the same thing functionally!

#### Funnel Chart

Best for: Showing stages in a process where values decrease

##### Perfect when

Sales funnel (Leads → Qualified → Demo → Closed)  
Conversion funnel (Visitors → Signup → Activated → Paid)  
Application process (Applied → Screened → Interviewed → Hired)

Example: Ecommerce funnel showing dropoff at each step

##### How to Configure

1.  Label Column: The stage names (Visit, Cart, Checkout, Purchase)  
    Order matters! Sort your query to put stages in order
2.  Value Column: The count or amount at each stage  
    Funnel automatically shows dropoff between stages
3.  Label Position:  
    Left: Labels on left side  
    Right: Labels on right side  
    Alternate: Alternate left and right

##### Pro Tips

Always sort your data in funnel order before charting  
Funnel automatically calculates conversion rates between stages  
Great for presentations instantly shows where you lose people

#### Table Chart

![table chart](https://docs.frappe.io/files/Q1%20Performance%20_%20Workbook.jpeg)

Best for: Displaying detailed data in rows and columns

##### Perfect when

You need to show exact values  
Data needs to be searchable/filterable  
Creating reports people will export  
Building pivot tables

Example: Customer list with details, Sales by Product and Month

##### How to Configure

1.  Rows: What becomes row headers (Customer, Product, Date, etc.)  
    Can add multiple row dimensions  
    Creates groupings/hierarchies
2.  Columns (optional): Create pivot table  
    Values become column headers  
    Example: Months become columns
3.  Values: What to display in cells (Sales, Count, Average, etc.)  
    Can show multiple values
4.  Display Options:  
    Show filter row: Add search boxes to each column  
    Show totals: Add row and column totals  
    Compact numbers: Show 1.2K instead of 1,200  
    Color scale: Heat map coloring (high values = darker)  
    Sticky columns: Pin columns when scrolling
5.  Conditional Formatting: Color cells based on rules  
    Highlight values above/below threshold  
    Color scales (red to green)  
    Custom rules

##### Pro Tips

Tables are perfect when exact numbers matter  
Use pivot mode (add columns) for crosstabulation  
Enable filter row for large datasets  
Sticky columns keep important columns visible while scrolling  
Color scale mode makes patterns jump out

#### Map Chart

Best for: Visualizing data geographically

##### Perfect when

Sales by country  
Users by region  
Store locations and performance

Example: Revenue by Country, Support tickets by State

##### How to Configure

1.  Map Type: Choose your geography  
    World Map: All countries  
    India: Indian states
2.  Location Column: Column with location names  
    Must match map region names  
    Examples: "India", "Delhi"
3.  Value Column: What to show (Sales, Count, etc.)  
    Determines color intensity  
    Higher values = darker colors

##### Pro Tips

Location names must match exactly (check spelling)  
Colors autoscale from light (low) to dark (high)  
Great for spotting geographic patterns  
Currently limited to World and India maps

##### Location Name Tips

Countries: Use full names ("United Kingdom" not "UK")  
US States: Full names or abbreviations work ("California" or "CA")  
India: Use official state names
