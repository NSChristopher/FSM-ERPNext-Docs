### Dashboard Components

#### Charts

Charts are the heart of your dashboard - they display your data visually.

Adding Charts

-   Click "Add Chart" button
-   Select one or more charts from your workbook
-   Charts appear on the dashboard in a grid

##### Working with Charts

-   Move: Click and drag to reposition
-   Resize: Drag the bottom-right corner to change size
-   View Details: Click the expand icon to see the full chart
-   Remove: Click the trash icon to delete from dashboard
-   Edit: Click the pencil icon to modify the chart

##### Pro Tips

-   Group related charts together
-   Put the most important metrics at the top
-   Use consistent sizing for visual harmony
-   Consider the reading flow (left to right, top to bottom)

#### Filters

Filters let viewers interact with your dashboard by controlling what data is displayed across multiple charts.

#### How Filters Work

-   One filter can control multiple charts
-   Viewers select values to filter all linked charts simultaneously
-   Great for date ranges, regions, products, or any category

#### Adding a Filter

1.  Click "Add Filter" button
2.  Give it a clear label (e.g., "Select Region", "Date Range")
3.  Choose the filter type:

```
- Text: For categories, names, statuses
- Number: For quantities, amounts, IDs
- Date: For time-based filtering
```

4.  Link it to charts:

```
- Toggle on the charts you want to control
- Select which column in each chart should be filtered
```

5.  Click "Apply"

#### Setting Up Filter Links

-   You can link one filter to different columns in different charts
-   Example: A "Region" filter might control:
    -   "Region" column in Sales chart
    -   "Store Region" column in Inventory chart
    -   "Customer Region" column in Orders chart

#### Filter Types Explained:

##### Text Filters

-   Use for: Categories, names, regions, statuses
-   Operators: equals, contains, starts with, in list
-   Example: Filter by Product Category = "Electronics"

##### Number Filters

-   Use for: Amounts, quantities, IDs, scores
-   Operators: equals, greater than, less than, between
-   Example: Filter by Order Amount > 1000

##### Date Filters

-   Use for: Time periods, deadlines, dates
-   Options: Specific date, date range, or relative (last 7 days, this month)
-   Example: Filter by Order Date = Last 30 Days

##### Pro Tips

-   Place filters at the top of the dashboard for easy access
-   Use clear labels that explain what the filter does
-   Limit to 3-5 filters to avoid overwhelming users
-   Group related filters together
-   Use relative date filters for dynamic dashboards
