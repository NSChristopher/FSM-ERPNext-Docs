-   **Users:** Choose the user(s) to whom Lead or Deal meeting the condition will be assigned.

## **Lead or Deal Routing**

Assignment Rules offer two rules for assigning Lead or Deal:

1.  **Auto-rotate:** This method distributes Lead or Deal evenly among the selected users. Each user receives one assignment at a time, and the cycle repeats once all users have been assigned.
2.  **Assign by workload:** This method assigns Lead or Deal to the user with the least workload, ensuring a fair distribution and preventing any single user from being overloaded.

## **Additional Fields**

**Unassignment condition:** Define a condition using the conditions builder for the unassignment rule, complex nested conditions are also supported. This will be used to unassign a Lead or Deal based on the condition specified

**Assignment Schedule:** Select the days you want the assignment rule to be active
