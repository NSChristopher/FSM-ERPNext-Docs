# Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that allows businesses to integrate voice, video, messaging, and authentication functionalities into their applications. This integration enables you to make calls directly from various pages within the CRM.

## Make call

-   **Lead page:** A call button is available in the right section above lead details. Use this button to initiate a call, but ensure the **Mobile No** field in the **Person** section includes the country code.

-   **Deal page:** In the **Contacts** section on the right side. You can add multiple contacts and designate a primary contact. The call button will utilize the primary contact's number.

-   **Contact page:** Directly initiate a call by clicking the **Mobile No** displayed below the contact's name.

## Call pop-up

Upon making or receiving a call, a pop-up window appears displaying:

-   Caller name
-   Mobile number
-   Call status
-   Call duration
-   Mute button
-   Note button
-   Action buttons (Accept, Reject, Cancel Call)

This window can be minimized, allowing navigation to other screens, while remaining accessible in the far-right corner of the navbar.

While on a call, you can take notes using the note button. These notes are saved in the Call Log for later viewing and editing.
