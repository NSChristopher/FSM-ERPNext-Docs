# Installation

Frappe CRM can be installed in multiple ways, depending on your requirements. You can either use **Frappe Cloud** for a fully managed experience or install CRM on your own server.

The following sections explain each installation method in detail.

* * *

## Managed Hosting (Frappe Cloud)

You can install Frappe CRM with a single click using **[Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com/crm/signup)**, the managed hosting platform for Frappe applications.

-   Sign up [here](https://frappecloud.com/crm/signup) to get started
-   Your CRM instance will be ready in a few minutes

If you already have a Frappe Cloud site, you can install Frappe CRM directly from the **[Frappe Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.frappe.io/marketplace/apps/crm)**.

Tip

Recommendation: We strongly recommend trying Frappe Cloud before opting for self-hosting.

## Self Hosting

### Production Setup

Follow these steps to set up Frappe CRM in production:

**Step 1**: Download the easy install script

```
wget https://frappe.io/easy-install.py
```

**Step 2**: Run the deployment command

```
python3 ./easy-install.py deploy \
    --project=crm_prod_setup \
    --email=email.example.com \
    --image=ghcr.io/frappe/crm \
    --version=stable \
    --app=crm \
    --sitename subdomain.domain.tld
```

Replace the following parameters with your values:

-   `your_email.example.com`: Your email address
-   `subdomain.domain.tld`: Your domain name where CRM will be hosted

The script will set up a production-ready instance of Frappe CRM with all the necessary configurations in about 5 minutes.

Note

If hosting on a public server, make sure your DNS A record points to your server's IP and if hosting locally, map your domain to 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/hosts file to avoid 404 Page Not Found error.
