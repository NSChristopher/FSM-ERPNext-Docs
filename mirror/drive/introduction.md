# Introduction

## What is Frappe Drive?

You dislike domination of Google and closed-source cloud solutions. Given the sensitivity of this structure, you expect that there is some good open source solution.

To your horror, you click through them all - NextCloud, OwnCloud - and none of them satisfy you. They are slow. The UI is subpar. They feel flaky.

And then you discover Frappe Drive.

Aesthetic. Powerful. Reliable.

## Why Frappe Drive?

The idea of building a drive-like application has been floating around in Frappe since atleast [2015](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/issues/8723#issuecomment-164223523). While Frappe Framework has rather robust file handling itself, the need arose for building a standalone solution. As we dug deeper, what began as a simple file-sharing platform evolved into a comprehensive collaboration tool.

## Key Features

Core — the file manager

-   Large file uploads using multi-part uploads
-   Folder uploads to maintain your structure in Drive
-   Preview files directly in your browser, [supported file previews](https://docs.frappe.io/drive/previews)
-   Stream videos directly from the server
-   Search for all your files and files shared shared with you
-   View activity logs of a file to glance at the changes in permissions and file metadata
-   Share files and folders with users, groups, everyone on the site or publish publicly
-   Add guest users who have limited and controlled access to your site
-   Pool storage of all users together or assign a quota of storage to each user

Writer — the document editor

-   Collaborate with other users or guests in real time
-   Annotate, resolve and reply to other users to give suggestions
-   Manually version your documents to always be able to go back to an older version
-   Automatic versioning to make sure you never lose data
-   Import docx documents into the editor
