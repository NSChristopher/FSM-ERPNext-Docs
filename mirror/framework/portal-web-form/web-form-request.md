# Web Form Request

## Web Form Request

A **Web Form Request** creates a private request link for a **Web Form**.

Use it when a form should not be fully public, but the respondent should still be able to submit it without having a user account. For example, you can send a customer satisfaction survey link to a customer, pre-fill customer-specific values, and keep internal fields hidden from the browser.

## When to Use

Use a **Web Form Request** when:

1.  The respondent should open the form through a private link.
2.  The respondent may not have a user account.
3.  The form should include respondent-specific values.
4.  The target document needs hidden values that should not be exposed in the web page.

## Creating a Request

Create a **Web Form Request** and select the _Web Form_ it belongs to. A URL-safe key is generated automatically.

The request can define:

-   _Expires On_: expiry date and time for the request key.
-   _Web Form Values_: JSON values shown in the web form and editable by the respondent.
-   _Doc Values_: JSON values applied to the target document on submission, but not sent to the browser.

The request key is used in the web form URL:

```
/your-web-form-route/new?web_form_request_key=<key>
```

You can copy this URL from the **Web Form Request** form.

## Requiring a Key

Enable _Key required_ on the **Web Form** to require a valid **Web Form Request** key.

If _Key required_ is enabled and no valid key is provided, the web form cannot be opened or submitted.

If _Login required_ is also enabled, both conditions apply: the user must be logged in and must provide a valid request key.

## Pre-filled and Hidden Values

Use _Web Form Values_ for fields that should be visible to the respondent. These fields must be included in the **Web Form** fields table.

Use _Doc Values_ for fields that should be set on the created document but should not be visible to the respondent. These fields must exist on the target DocType.

The JSON keys must use the underlying field names, for example `customer` or `survey_source`.

Example:

```
{
 "customer": "CUST-0001",
 "survey_source": "Partner CSAT"
}
```

## Expiry and Usage

If _Expires On_ is set, the request key cannot be used after that date and time.

For a single-response web form, the request is marked as used after successful submission and links to the created target document. This allows the same key to be used later for editing or deleting that response if the **Web Form** settings allow it.

For a **Web Form** with _Allow multiple responses_ enabled, the request key can be reused for multiple submissions and does not link to a single target document.

## Related Web Form Settings

-   _Allow Multiple Responses:_  
    If enabled, the same request key can submit multiple responses. In this mode, the **Web Form Request** cannot have a _Reference Docname_, because one request may create many documents.
-   _Allow Editing After Submit:_  
    If enabled, a request key linked to a response can open and edit that response.
-   _Allow Delete:_  
    If enabled, a request key linked to a response can delete that response.
