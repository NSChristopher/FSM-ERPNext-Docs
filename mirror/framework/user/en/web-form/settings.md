# Settings

## Webform Settings

There are multiple checkboxs in the `Settings` tab that can be used to enable and disable different functionalities.

### Login Required

If you want responses from guest user, just disable the `login_required` checkbox. Logged In users can also use it. It is disabled by default.

If you only want responses from logged in user just enable the `login_required` checkbox.

> Enabling it will make **Allow Multiple Responses, Allow Editing After Submit, Allow Delete, Allow Comments, Show Attachments** and **Show List** checkboxes visible.

### Key Required

Enable _Key required_ when the Web Form should only be opened with a private key from a [Web Form Request](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/web-form/web-form-request).

This is useful for surveys or invitation flows where the respondent does not have a user account, but the form should not be public. The request key can carry visible pre-filled form values and hidden document values.

If _Login required_ is also enabled, the user must be logged in and must have a valid request key.
