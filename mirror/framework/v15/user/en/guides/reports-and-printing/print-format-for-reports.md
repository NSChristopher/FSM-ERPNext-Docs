# Report Print Formats

In version 4.1 we introduce Report Print Formats. These are HTML templates that you can use to format Query Report data for printing.

### 1\. Creating New Print Formats

To create a new Print Format, just drop in a `.html` file in the folder of the query report. For example, for the [General Ledger](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/tree/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/general_ledger) report in ERPNext, you can drop in a file called `general_ledger.html` along side the `.js` and `.py` files.

##### Tree Of `erpnext/accounts/general_ledger`

```
general_ledger/
├── __init__.py
├── general_ledger.html
├── general_ledger.js
├── general_ledger.json
└── general_ledger.py
```

### 2\. Templating

For templating, we use an adapted version of [John Resig's microtemplating script](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/). If you know Javascript, it is very easy to follow this templating language.

##### Here are some examples (from John Resig's Blog):

Example: Properities:

```
![](<%=profile_image_url%>)

**[<%=from_user%>](<%=from_user%>):** <%=text%>
```

Example: Code structures, Loops

```
<% for ( var i = 0; i < users.length; i++ ) { %>
- [<%=users[i].name%>](<%=users[i].url%>)
<% } %>
```

> **Note**: It is important to note that you should not use single quotes (') in your template as the engine cannot handle them effectively.

### 3\. Data

Data is available to the template as:

-   `data`: this is a list of records, with each record as an object with slugified properties from labels. For example "Posting Date" becomes "posting\_date"
-   `filters`: filters set in the report
-   `report`: reportview object

### 4\. Example

Here is how the General Ledger Report is built:

[General Ledger Print Format Template](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/general_ledger/general_ledger.html)

Here is what the report looks like:

##### Comments:

1.  [Bootstrap Stylesheet](https://getbootstrap.com) is pre-loaded.
2.  You can use all global functions like `fmt_money` and dateutil.
3.  Translatable strings should be written as `__("text")`
4.  You can create modules and import using `{% include "templates/includes/formats/common_format" %}`
