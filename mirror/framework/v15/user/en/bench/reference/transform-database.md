# bench transform-database

> This command is added in **Version 14**, and supports only **MariaDB**

## Usage

```
bench transform-database [OPTIONS] table
```

## Description

The `transform-database` command allows you to manage the settings of your site's tables. At this point, you can switch engines and row\_format settings for select tables on your site database.

> MariaDB 10.6 deprecated the COMPRESSED ROW\_FORMAT which was Frappe's default option for a very long time. This command was added to handle upgrades to later versions of MariaDB. For more information on this, refer to the [PR](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/pull/13954).

## Options

-   `--table` Comma separated name of tables to convert. To convert all tables, pass 'all' **\[required\]**
-   `--engine` Choice of storage engine for said table(s). Options available are _InnoDB_ and _MyISAM_.
-   `--row_format` Set _ROW\_FORMAT_ parameter for said table(s). Options available are _DYNAMIC_, _COMPACT_, _REDUNDANT_, _COMPRESSED_.

## Flags

-   `failfast` Exit on first failure occurred

### Examples

1.  Consider a scenario where you'd want to change the engine of a table _"tabAccess Record"_ to `MyISAM`. You may want to do this if it's a log table that's dealing with huge volumes of writes and very little reads.

```
bench --site {site} transform-database --table 'tabAccess Record' --engine 'MyISAM'
```

2.  You've upgraded MariaDB on your current server from 10.3 to 10.7 and you want to convert all the tables that used the COMPRESSED row\_format to the new default, ie `DYNAMIC`. You'd want to run the following command.

```
bench --site {site} transform-database --table 'all' --row_format 'DYNAMIC'
```
