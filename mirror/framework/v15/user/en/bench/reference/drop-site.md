# bench drop-site

## Usage

```
bench drop-site [OPTIONS] SITE
```

## Description

Drop an existing site. In this operation, the database is dropped and the  
respective site's folder is moved from `./sites` to `./archived_sites` _(unless  
specified otherwise)_ on your Bench. A full site backup is taken prior to this.

## Options

-   `--db-root-username` Username for a DBMS user with drop database privileges.  
    Defaults to _root_
-   `--db-root-password` Password for the DBMS user
-   `--archived-sites-path` Specify the path to move the site's folder in

## Flags

-   `--no-backup` Skip backup prior to site drop
-   `--force` Force drop-site even if an error is encountered

### Examples

1.  Skip the interactive prompt by passing the root password.

```
bench drop-site {site} --db-root-password {db-root-pass}
```

1.  Skip taking a backup before site deletion.

```
bench drop-site {site} --no-backup
```

1.  Move the site's folder in a different folder instead of the standard  
    `./archived_sites`.

```
bench drop-site {site} --archived-sites-path {path/to/archive}
```
