# Asset Maintenance | ERPNext Documentation

Imagine a Nova Industries packaging machine needs inspection every month and a belt replacement every six months. If the team depends on memory, a missed service could stop production and cost much more than the maintenance itself.

  

Asset Maintenance turns those recurring jobs into a planned schedule. It records what must be done, how often it should happen, and who is responsible, helping the team service equipment before it fails.

## Before you begin

Enable **Maintenance Required** on the Asset and create an [Asset Maintenance Team](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/asset-maintenance-team).

## Create a maintenance plan

1.  Select the Asset and Maintenance Team.
2.  Add a task with its type, start date, periodicity, assignee, and description.
3.  Mark whether a certificate is required.
4.  Save the plan. ERPNext creates planned [Asset Maintenance Logs](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/asset-maintenance-log) for the schedule.

## Follow the work

Open the generated log, record actions performed, add a certificate when required, and mark the work completed.

## Troubleshooting

### No maintenance logs were created

Check the start date, end date, periodicity, and assignee, then save the maintenance plan again.

### The task is overdue

Complete or cancel the correct log. Do not only change the plan because the historical occurrence still needs a result.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is preventive maintenance the same as repair?

In ERPNext, no. Maintenance is planned work. Asset Repair records a failure, downtime, repair cost, and possible capitalization.

### Can one Asset have several tasks?

In ERPNext, yes. Add separate rows for checks, calibration, cleaning, or certification.

### Does maintenance affect asset value?

Routine maintenance normally does not. A qualifying repair cost can be capitalized through the repair workflow.
