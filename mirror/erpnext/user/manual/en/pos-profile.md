# POS Profile

In ERPNext, a POS profile allows using the Point of Sale feature to some extent for “Paid” Sales Invoice.

POS includes advanced features to cater to different functionality, such as inventory management, financials, warehousing, etc., all built into the POS software.

If you are in retail operations, you want your Point of Sale to be as quick and efficient as possible. To do this, you can create a POS Profile for a user.

POS Profile is also utilized in

_Home > Selling > POS > POS Profile_

## Additional Options when creating a POS Profile

-   **Customer:** If a Customer is set on POS Profile, selecting the POS Profile on the Sales Invoice/POS Invoice will set the same Customer.

  

### Applicable for Users

By default, all Sales Users can access the POS Profiles created in ERPNext. However, if you want only certain Users to access certain POS Profiles, you can add them to the table. Once even one User is set in the POS Profile, other Users cannot use this POS Profile for retail transactions.

Setting POS Profile as default: On ticking the Default checkbox in the table, the current POS Profile becomes the default POS Profile for that User. So, the next time the User logs into the system, the POS Profile will be set by default.

_Note: If you specify a particular User, the POS setting will be applied only to that User. If the User option is left blank, the setting will be set for all users. To understand how POS works, visit the Point of Sale page._

### Payment Methods
