# Asset Maintenance Team | ERPNext Documentation

Imagine Nova Industries has electricians, IT technicians, and machine specialists. When a laptop or production machine needs work, assigning the wrong person wastes time and may leave the real problem unresolved.

  

An Asset Maintenance Team groups the people who can perform a type of maintenance. The team can then be selected on a maintenance plan so everyone knows who is responsible for each scheduled task.

## Create a team

1.  Open **Asset Maintenance Team** and select **Add**.
2.  Enter a team name and company.
3.  Select a Maintenance Manager.
4.  Add members and their maintenance roles.
5.  Save, then use the team in [Asset Maintenance](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/asset-maintenance) plans.

| Field | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Maintenance Manager** | User who supervises the plan. |
| **Team Member** | User who can be assigned maintenance work. |
| **Maintenance Role** | Role used to describe or authorize the member's responsibility. |
| **Company** | Company whose assets the team maintains. |

## Troubleshooting

### A user cannot be selected as a member

Confirm the User is enabled and has access to the relevant company and Assets records.

### Tasks are assigned to the wrong person

Correct the task's Assign To field. The team defines available ownership but each task controls its assignee.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can the same user be in more than one team?

In ERPNext, yes, when that reflects operational responsibility.

### Does the team itself create tasks?

In ERPNext, no. The Asset Maintenance plan creates scheduled tasks and logs using the selected team.

### Can teams be company specific?

In ERPNext, yes. Keep the selected company aligned with the Assets the team will maintain.
