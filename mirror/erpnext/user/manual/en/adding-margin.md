# Add Margin to Quotations and Sales Orders | ERPNext Documentation

Margin increases an item's transaction Rate above its Price List Rate. ERPNext can apply a percentage or fixed amount directly on a [Quotation](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/quotation) or [Sales Order](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/sales-order) item, or apply it automatically through a [Pricing Rule](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/pricing-rule).

## Before you begin

Create:

-   The required [Item](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/item).
-   A selling [Price List](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/price-lists).
-   An [Item Price](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/item-price) that supplies the Price List Rate.

Margin needs a reference Price List Rate. If no rate is fetched, verify the Item Price before troubleshooting the margin calculation.

## Add margin directly to an item

1.  Create a Quotation or Sales Order.
2.  Select the Customer, Price List, and Item.
3.  Select the highlighted pencil icon to open the complete item-row editor.
4.  Set **Margin Type** to **Percentage** or **Amount**.
5.  Enter **Margin Rate or Amount**.
6.  Review the calculated Rate and Amount.
7.  Save.

## Margin calculation

For a fixed margin:

`Rate = Price List Rate + Margin Amount`

For a percentage margin:

`Rate = Price List Rate + (Price List Rate × Margin Percentage ÷ 100)`

Example:

| Value | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Price List Rate | $1,000 |
| Margin | 15% |
| Margin amount | $150 |
| Resulting Rate | $1,150 |

Any item discount is evaluated separately. Review Price List Rate, Margin, Discount, Rate, and Net Rate together when both are used.

## Apply margin automatically with a Pricing Rule

Use a Pricing Rule when the same margin should apply under repeatable conditions.

1.  Create or open a Pricing Rule.
2.  Configure its applicability, such as Item, Item Group, Customer, Customer Group, quantity, amount, and validity.
3.  In the **Margin** section, select Percentage or Amount.
4.  Enter the Margin Rate or Amount.
5.  Save and enable the rule.
6.  Test it on a new Quotation or Sales Order.

When several rules can match, review their priorities and conditions. A more specific rule may need a higher priority than a general Item Group rule.

## Margin and discounts

Margin and discount solve different pricing needs:

-   Margin adds a markup to the Price List Rate.
-   [Applying a Discount](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/applying-discount) reduces a price or total.
-   A fixed Pricing Rule Rate can replace the fetched rate.

Avoid combining them without a documented pricing policy. Users should be able to explain how the final Rate was reached.

## Downstream transactions

When a Sales Order is created from a Quotation, or a [Sales Invoice](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/sales-invoice) is created later in the cycle, verify the mapped Rate. [Selling Settings](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/selling-settings) can warn or stop users when the rate changes through the sales cycle.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Margin fields do not affect Rate | Confirm that a Price List Rate was fetched |
| Margin is not applied automatically | Verify the Pricing Rule is enabled, valid, and matches the transaction |
| A different rule wins | Review rule priority, Item or party specificity, and overlapping conditions |
| The downstream rate changes | Review mapped values and the Maintain Same Rate setting |
| Final profitability is unclear | Margin is based on Price List Rate, not necessarily valuation or purchase cost |

## Frequently asked questions

### Is margin calculated from valuation rate?

No. The item margin fields use Price List Rate as their pricing reference.

### Can I add a fixed dollar margin?

Yes. Select Amount as the Margin Type.

### Can margin apply to Sales Invoices?

Margin fields are primarily entered on Quotation and Sales Order items. Downstream documents can carry the resulting rate.

### How do I enforce a minimum selling price?

Review the selling-price validation in Selling Settings and test it against your purchase or valuation rates.
