# Asset | ERPNext Documentation

An Asset record is the operating history of something the company uses. For Nova Industries' staff laptop, it connects the Item and purchase value to a current location, maintenance plan, depreciation schedule, and eventual disposal.

  

Create one only after deciding whether the item is company equipment rather than inventory held for sale.

## Before you begin

Prepare the fixed-asset Item, [Asset Category](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/asset-category), company accounts, and [Asset Location](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/asset-location). Use [Purchasing an Asset](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/purchasing-an-asset) when the record originates from a new purchase.

## Create an Asset

1.  Open **Asset** and select **Add Asset**.
2.  Select the Item and company.
3.  Enter a recognizable Asset Name and current Location.
4.  Select **Existing Asset** only when bringing an already-owned asset into ERPNext. Use **Composite Asset** when the asset is assembled by capitalization.
5.  Enter purchase and available-for-use dates, value, and quantity.
6.  Enable maintenance and depreciation only when they apply.

## Important fields and what they mean

| Field | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Item Code** | The reusable Item definition for this asset model. |
| **Asset Name** | The human-readable identity, such as an internal tag or serial reference. |
| **Location** | Current physical position. |
| **Asset Type** | Existing, Composite Asset, or Composite Component. |
| **Purchase Date** | Date the company acquired the asset. |

## Review depreciation

Each Finance Book may have a different method, useful life, residual value, and posting frequency.

## Troubleshooting

### The Asset value or account is wrong

Trace the source purchase, category account defaults, and any capitalization or value-adjustment entries. Do not correct only the visible total without understanding the ledger source.

### The Asset cannot be cancelled

Cancel or reverse linked submitted depreciation and disposal documents in the required order first.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I change the location directly?

Use Asset Movement for a controlled transfer and an auditable history.

### Can I store insurance information?

In ERPNext, yes. Use the insurance fields for insurer, policy dates, insured value, and coverage details.

### Can one Asset contain multiple units?

Grouped assets support quantity-based use cases, but individual assets are clearer when each unit needs its own custodian, maintenance, or disposal history.
