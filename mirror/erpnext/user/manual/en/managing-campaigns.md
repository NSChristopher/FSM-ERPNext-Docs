# Email Campaign | ERPNext Documentation

**An Email Campaign is a coordinated set of emails sent to leads or contacts according to a particular schedule.**

Email Campaigns are still one of the most effective ways to reach your Customers, Contacts or Leads and keep them engaged. For example, you could set up Email Campaigns for introducing your product to the customers, with every email revealing an interesting feature of your product.

To create an Email Campaign, go to:

> Home > CRM > Campaign > Email Campaign

-   [Campaign](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/campaign)
-   [Lead](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/lead) or [Contact](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/contact) or [Email Group](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/email_group)

## How to Create an Email Campaign

Notice the 'End Date' in the above Email Campaign. It is '26-07-2019', which is 4 days after the 'Start Date', '22-07-2029', as the Campaign Schedule ends on day 4.

-   Go to the Campaign for which you want to create Email Campaigns.

### Unsubscribe from Email Campaign

If a lead or contact does not want to continue getting emails regarding the campaign, he or she can unsubscribe from the Email Campaign via the unsubscribe link sent with the email.

![Unsubscribe Link](https://docs.frappe.io/files/unsubscribe-link.png)

When the lead or contact unsubscribes, the status of the Email Campaign document changes to 'Unsubscribed'.

### Use Lead or Contact fields in Email Template

The Email Template has the context of the document you have specified in the 'Email Campaign For' field. If you want to display the fields from your Lead or Contact document in your Email Template you will have to use doc.fieldname for the same.  
For example, if 'Email Campaign For' is 'Contact', you can mention the 'first name' of your Contact as doc.first\_name in the Email Template as shown below:

![Email Template Document](https://docs.frappe.io/files/email-template-doc.png)

Then the emails sent would look like this:
