# Freeze an Account | ERPNext Documentation

Freeze an individual ledger Account when users should be able to see its history but should no longer post new transactions to it. This is useful after replacing a bank, expense, income, receivable, or payable account without deleting the older ledger.

  

Freezing does not remove the Account or its existing [General Ledger](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/general-ledger) entries. It prevents ordinary users from using that Account in new accounting transactions. An explicitly authorized role can still set frozen Accounts and create or modify entries against them.

> Freeze only an Account that should no longer receive postings. If you need to prevent entries for a past date range instead, use [Freeze Accounting Entries](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/freeze-accounting-entries) or an [Accounting Period](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/accounting-period).

## Before you begin

Confirm that:

1.  The Account is a ledger Account, not a group used to organize the [Chart of Accounts](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/chart-of-accounts).
2.  Users should retain access to its historical transactions and balances.
3.  A replacement Account is available if future invoices, payments, or journals still need a ledger for the same purpose.
4.  Defaults in the Company, Customer, Supplier, Item, tax templates, and [Mode of Payment](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/mode-of-payment) no longer point to the Account you plan to freeze.
5.  The role permitted to manage frozen Accounts has been reviewed.

## Authorize a role to manage frozen Accounts

The permission is company-specific in the current ERPNext interface.

1.  Open the required **Company**.
2.  Select the **Accounts Closing** tab.
3.  In **Roles Allowed to Set and Edit Frozen Account Entries**, select the role that may freeze Accounts and post or modify entries against them.
4.  Save the Company.

Grant this role sparingly. A user with it can bypass the restriction when posting to a frozen Account. In older ERPNext documentation, this control may be described as an Accounts Settings field. On the current develop interface it appears in the Company's **Accounts Closing** tab.

## Freeze an Account

1.  Open **Accounting > Chart of Accounts**.
2.  Select the Company.
3.  Open the ledger Account that should stop receiving transactions.
4.  Set **Frozen** to **Yes**.
5.  Save the Account.

After saving, ordinary users cannot use the Account in accounting transactions. Existing [Journal Entries](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/journal-entry), invoices, payments, and reports remain connected to it.

## What freezing changes

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| New accounting transactions | Ordinary users cannot post entries against the frozen Account. |
| Authorized role | Users with the Company role configured for frozen Account entries can set the Account as frozen and post or modify entries against it. |
| Existing ledger history | Remains available in the General Ledger and financial reports. |
| Account master | Remains in the Chart of Accounts and can be unfrozen later. |
| Defaults that reference the Account | Are not automatically replaced. Update them before users create new transactions. |
| Date-based locks | Are unchanged. Freezing one Account is separate from freezing entries through a date or closing an Accounting Period. |

## Verify the change

After saving:

1.  Reopen the Account and confirm **Frozen** is **Yes**.
2.  Check that active defaults now use the intended replacement ledger.
3.  Open the [General Ledger report](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/general-ledger) and confirm the historical Account balance remains visible.
4.  If your controls require a test, use a draft transaction with a test user who does not have the exception role. Do not submit an incorrect entry merely to test the restriction.

## Unfreeze an Account

An authorized user can reopen the Account, set **Frozen** to **No**, and save. Before unfreezing, confirm why postings need to resume and whether a newer Account has already replaced it. Allowing both Accounts to remain active can split transactions and make [financial statements](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/accounting-reports) harder to reconcile.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Frozen cannot be changed | Confirm that your user has the role selected in the Company's Accounts Closing settings. |
| A transaction still posts to the frozen Account | Check whether the user has the authorized role. Also confirm that the transaction used the Account you froze, not a similarly named ledger. |
| New transactions default to the frozen Account | Replace the Account in Company and master defaults, tax templates, payment modes, and transaction templates. |
| A past period must be locked | Use Accounts Frozen Till Date or an Accounting Period. Freezing an Account controls a ledger, not a date range. |
| Reports still show the Account | This is expected. Freezing stops new postings and does not remove historical balances. |

## Frequently asked questions

### Does freezing an Account delete it?

No, The Account and its historical ledger entries remain available. The restriction applies to new or modified accounting entries.

### Is a frozen Account the same as a disabled Account?

No, **Frozen** is an accounting control that blocks ordinary postings while permitting a configured role to handle exceptions. **Disable** is a broader master-state control. Use the option that matches your control objective.

### Can an authorized user post to a frozen Account?

Yes, A user with the role configured in **Roles Allowed to Set and Edit Frozen Account Entries** can create or modify entries against it. Keep that role limited and review its assignments.

### Does freezing an Account affect its balance?

No, Existing debits, credits, and balances remain unchanged. The Account continues to appear in reports based on its historical postings.

### When should I use a date freeze instead?

Use **Accounts Frozen Till Date** when the restriction should apply to accounting entries before a cutoff date. Use an Accounting Period when selected transaction types must be closed for a completed period. Use **Frozen** on the Account when one specific ledger should stop receiving entries regardless of date.
