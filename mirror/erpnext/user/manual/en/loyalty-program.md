# Configure Customer Loyalty Programs | ERPNext Documentation

A Loyalty Program awards points from submitted sales and lets eligible Customers redeem those points on later [Sales Invoices](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/sales-invoice). Programs can use one tier or several tiers based on a Customer's cumulative eligible spend.

## Before you begin

Confirm:

-   Eligible [Customers](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/customer), Customer Groups, and Territories.
-   The Company currency and loyalty expense account.
-   A Cost Center for redemption when required.
-   A policy for earning, redemption value, expiry, returns, and tier upgrades.

Test point creation and accounting on the demo Company before enrolling Customers.

## Create a Loyalty Program

1.  Open the Loyalty Program list and select **Add Loyalty Program**.
2.  Enter the Program Name.
3.  Select **Single Tier** or **Multiple Tier**.
4.  Set From Date and To Date.
5.  Restrict the Customer Group and Territory when required.
6.  Enable **Auto Opt In** only when all eligible Customers should join automatically.
7.  Add the tier rows.
8.  Configure redemption and expiry.
9.  Save.

## Configure tiers

![The Loyalty Program tier table with collection factors and thresholds.](https://novacompanies.m.frappe.cloud/files/loyalty-program-tiers.png)

| Field | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Tier Name | Label assigned when the Customer reaches the threshold |
| Collection Factor | Eligible amount required to earn one point |
| Minimum Amount | Cumulative spend required for the tier |
| Auto Opt In | Enrolls all Customers that match the program conditions |

Example: with a Collection Factor of $100, an eligible $1,000 invoice earns 10 points.

Minimum Amount is evaluated from cumulative eligible sales for the Customer, not only the current invoice.

## Configure redemption

Set:

-   **Conversion Factor** for the monetary value of one point.
-   **Expense Account** used for the loyalty benefit.
-   **Cost Center** where required.
-   **Expiry Duration** in days.

Keep earning and redemption factors distinct. A Customer might spend $100 to earn one point while each redeemed point is worth $1.

## Enroll a Customer

If Auto Opt In is disabled:

1.  Open the Customer.
2.  Select the Loyalty Program.
3.  Save.

## Earn points

Create and submit an eligible Sales Invoice. ERPNext creates a Loyalty Point Entry linked to the Customer and invoice.

Open **Loyalty Point Entry** to audit earned and redeemed points. Returns and cancellations can affect the available balance, so use the ledger rather than a manually maintained total.

## Redeem points

1.  Create a Sales Invoice for the enrolled Customer.
2.  Add the Items.
3.  Open the Loyalty Points section.
4.  Enable **Redeem Loyalty Points**.
5.  Enter the number of points.
6.  Confirm the Redemption Account and Cost Center.
7.  Review the invoice total and submit.

The dot before an Item Code shows stock availability at a glance: green means in stock and red means out of stock.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| No points are earned | Confirm enrollment, program dates, eligibility, submitted invoice, and tier factor |
| Redeem Loyalty Points is unavailable | Confirm that the Customer has a program and available points |
| The tier is unexpected | Review cumulative eligible spend and minimum thresholds |
| Points expired earlier than expected | Check Expiry Duration and the Loyalty Point Entry dates |
| Redemption accounting is incorrect | Review the program's Expense Account and Cost Center |

## Frequently asked questions
