-   **Users:** Choose the user(s) to whom tickets meeting the condition will be assigned.
    

## **Ticket Routing**

Assignment Rules offer two rules for assigning tickets:

1.  **Auto-rotate:** This method distributes tickets evenly among the selected users. Each user receives one assignment at a time, and the cycle repeats once all users have been assigned.
2.  **Assign by workload:** This method assigns tickets to the user with the least workload, ensuring a fair distribution and preventing any single user from being overloaded.

## **Additional Fields**

**Unassignment condition:** Define condition using the conditions builder for the unassignment rule, complex nested conditions are also supported. This will be used to unassign a ticket based on the condition specified

**Assignment Schedule:** Select the days you want the assignment rule to be active
