# Bulk Reply

# Bulk Reply

Bulk Reply lets an agent send the **same response to several tickets at once**, instead of opening each ticket and replying one by one. Each customer still receives a private, individual reply on their own ticket; they never see that the message went to anyone else.

  

  

## How to use it

1.  Go to the **Tickets** list.
2.  **Select the tickets** you want to reply to using the checkboxes on the left of each row. A selection bar appears at the bottom.
3.  Click **Bulk Reply** in the selection bar.
4.  In the **Bulk Reply** window, type your message in the editor.
5.  (Optional) Add attachments — see [Attachments](#attachments) below.
6.  Click the send button:

-   **Send Reply** when one ticket is selected.
-   **Send to N tickets** when several are selected (N shows the exact count).

> 💡 **Shortcut:** Press **⌘ + Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) to send without reaching for the mouse.

  

For each ticket, the reply is sent to **the person who raised that ticket** (the ticket's requester).  
When the reply is sent, you'll see a confirmation like _"Bulk reply sent successfully to 5 tickets."_  
The message is recorded in each ticket's conversation, exactly as if you had replied to each one individually.

  

## Signature is added automatically

Your **email signature is inserted into the reply for you** — you don't need to type or paste it. The editor opens with your signature already in place, and the cursor positioned above it so you can start writing straight away.

The signature comes from your personal email signature in Helpdesk. If you'd like to change what appears, update your signature in your settings, and it will be used the next time you reply.

  

## Attachments

You can attach files (screenshots, PDFs, documents) to a bulk reply:

1.  Click the **attachment (paperclip) icon** in the editor toolbar.
2.  Choose the file(s) to upload. Each file appears as a chip below the editor once uploaded.
3.  To remove a file before sending, click the **✕** on its chip. Every attachment you add is included with the reply sent to **each** selected ticket, and is also saved on each ticket so it's available later in the ticket's attachments.

> ⏳ Wait for files to finish uploading — the send button stays disabled until uploads complete.

  

## Good to know

-   **Drafts are remembered.** If you close the window before sending, your typed message and attachments are kept. They're cleared only when you **Send** or click **Discard**.
-   **Each reply is private.** Customers receive only the reply on their own ticket — recipients are never exposed to each other.
-   **Discard** closes the window and clears the draft without sending anything.

  

## Frequently asked

Q) Does the customer know this was a bulk reply?

A) No. Each customer sees a normal, individual reply on their ticket.

  

Q) Can I reply to just one ticket with this?

A) Yes — select a single ticket and the button reads **Send Reply**. It works the same as a regular reply, with your signature added automatically.

  

Q) Who receives the reply?

A) For each ticket, the reply goes to the person who raised that ticket. It's emailed to them according to your Helpdesk's email settings, and is also stored in the ticket's conversation.
