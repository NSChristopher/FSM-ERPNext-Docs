# Email Notifications

Some emails are sent by Helpdesk based on the activities carried out by the users. Currently, there are 4 kinds of emails:

-   Share Feedback
-   Acknowledgement
-   Reply From Contact
-   Reply From Agent

To customize the content and the related options associated with each kind of email, you can use the 'Email Notifications' tab of the settings view.

## Share Feedback

This email is sent to the user who has raised the ticket after the ticket is closed or resolved. The purpose of the email is to get feedback on the support experience.

This **only works** for **tickets** raised via **Email**, as we already have provision to get feedback for the tickets raised via customer portal.

If **feedback** already **exists** for the ticket, the **email** will **not** be **sent**.

The available customizations are highlighted in the image below.
