# Twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that allows businesses to integrate voice, video, messaging, and authentication functionalities into their applications. This integration enables you to make calls directly from various pages within the Helpdesk.

To configure Twilio for use within the Helpdesk, follow these steps:

1.  **Twilio Subscription:** Obtain an active Twilio subscription (refer to Twilio's documentation for details).
2.  **Twilio Credentials:** From your Twilio account, retrieve your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio Mobile Number.
3.  **Settings**: Click the dropdown menu on the top left logo and select "Settings."

## Twilio API configuration

For your Helpdesk's API to connect with Twilio, perform the following configurations within Twilio:

1.  **Incoming Call API URL:** Under **Phone Numbers** -> **Manage** -> **Active Numbers**, select your mobile number. Locate the **Voice Configuration** form and within the "**A call comes in**" section, add the following **URL** to the URL field:

```
  "https://<yoursitename>/api/method/telephony.twilio.api.twilio_incoming_call_handler"
```

```
