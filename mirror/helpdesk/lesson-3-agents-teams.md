# Agents & Teams

In Helpdesk, the way tickets are handled depends on three key concepts: Roles, Agents, and Teams.

### 1\. Roles

Roles define what a user can do in the system. There are three main roles:

-   **Admin**  
    Has full access across the system — including all tickets, settings, teams, and configurations.
    
-   **Agent Manager**
    
    -   Work on tickets
    -   Delete tickets
    -   Create custom views and manage [public views](https://docs.frappe.io/helpdesk/custom-views)
    -   Manage Knowledge Base articles
    -   Manage Dashboard and get an overview of other agents in your team
-   **Agent**
    
    -   Work on tickets
    -   Create custom views and manage private views
    -   Manage Knowledge Base articles
    -   Manage Dashboard only for themselves

These roles help control permissions and ensure each user sees and does only what they’re meant to.

### 2\. Agents

Agents are the users responsible for working on support tickets. They’re assigned to tickets directly or through teams. Read [more](https://docs.frappe.io/helpdesk/agent) about agents.

-   They can belong to one or more teams.
-   Their workload is managed either manually or automatically through assignment rules.

### 3\. Teams (Agent Groups)

Teams, also referred to as **Agent Groups** in single ticket view, are used to group agents for ticket distribution and assignment.

-   A team consists of one or more agents.
-   When a new team is created, an [Assignment Rule](https://docs.frappe.io/helpdesk/assignment-rule) is automatically created in the system.
-   This rule ensures that when a ticket is assigned to that team, the system will pick one of the team members and assign the ticket to them — based on round-robin, load balancing, or some other logic.

You can manage the members of a team anytime — adding or removing agents immediately affects who gets assigned tickets.

Helpdesk creates two teams for you by default. Try adding members in each team and then try to assign a ticket to another team. You will notice that on changing the team (Agent Group), the ticket gets re-assigned to the agent of the selected team.

#### Custom Assignment Logic

You can also define your own assignment logic using [Server Scripts](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/desk/scripting/server-script).

For example, assign tickets to different teams based on priority:

This server script below ensures that based on priority, the teams & agents are assigned automatically.

Here is an example of auto agent group assignment:

```
if doc.priority == "Low":
    doc.agent_group = "Team A"
else:
    doc.agent_group = "Team B"
```
